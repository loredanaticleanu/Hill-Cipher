# Recomandation
- use Visual Studio 2017
- make sure that the project version is set to be debuged on VSVersion 140v1

# Alternatives
- you cand download Hill-Cipher.exe if you dont want to execute the code using a text compilator

# How to use it
- you will need to insert a message that will be crypted, message should have a length limit of 50 characters
- dont worry about the uppercase or lowercase
- you will need to insert the number of matrix rows and columns that will be used to crypt the message
- number of rows = number of columns, you can only use 2 or 3

- you will need to insert the values for the vector

# Known issues:
- message is inserted before key
- 3x3 matrix is not optimal
